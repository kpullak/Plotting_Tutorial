# Plotting_Tutorial
This is part of a workshop I was developing for Data Science Viz - NCSU
In this repo, I am going to add the tools and hopefully the final workshop that I prepared for helping 
students understand the different visualisation tools available to them from the most commonly used plotting
frameworks like matplotlib and seaborn.
